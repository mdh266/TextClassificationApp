    "Natural language processing or NLP is an hot topic in data science and machine learning.  While research in NLP dates back to the 1950's, the real revolution in this domain came in 1980's and 1990's with the introduction of statistical models and fast computational power. Before this most language processing tasks made use of hand-coded rules which were generally not very robust.\n",

The order of entries in the vector corresponds to the order of the entries in the bag-of-words list.  For example, document D1 would have a vector,\n",

    "In this blog post we covered document classification using Scikit-learn and the 20 News Groups dataset.  We went over the basics of term frequency-inverse document frequency, pipelines and the Naive Bayes classifier.  While we were able to improve the accuracy of the basic Naive Bayes classifier from 77% to 83%, there are much more sophisticated models like a <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm\">support vector machines</a> which can achieve higher performance.\n",

    "One thing that we did not address was the topic of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming\">stemming</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation\">lemmatisation</a>, which both have to do with reducing a word down to its base form and when used can improve the performance of text classification models.  Lemmatisation differs from stemming because it depends on identifying the intended part of speech and meaning of a word in a sentence.  Stemmers and lemmatizers are both provided by Natural Language Tool Kit or <a href=\"http://www.nltk.org/\">NLTK</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nltk.org/\">spaCy</a> libraries, but that will have to wait for another day!"
