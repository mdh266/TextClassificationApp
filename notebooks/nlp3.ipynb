    "In the last [blogpost](http://michael-harmon.com/blog/NLP2.html) we covered building a text classification using <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/\">Scikit-learn</a> and using the [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/). We used a weighted Support Vector Machine to handle the imbalance of the classes in the datset. Once we trained our model we then serialized the Scikit-learn pipeline using [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we'll build out a serverless web app using a few technologies. The advantage of using a serverless framework for me is cost effectiveness: I don't pay much at all unless people use my web app a ton and I don't expect people to visit this app very often. However, due to the serverless framework I will have issues with latency, which I can live with. I'll first go over how to convert my text classification model from the [last post](http://michael-harmon.com/blog/NLP2.html) into a Rest API using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Using our model in this way will allow us to send our paper abstracts as [json](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) through an HTTP request and get back the predicted topic label for the paper abstract. After this I'll build out a web application usign [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Using Bootstrap allows us to have a beautiful responsive website without having to write HTML or JavaScript. Finally, I'll go over deploying both the model API and Web app using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) to build out a serverless web application!\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we serve the model as a rest API seperate from the web app is that it gives us the ability test the model API independently. It also allows us to redploy a different model without having to redploy our web app! \n",

    "Let's get into to the first step of converting our model as a Rest API."

FastAPI has a number of advantages over Flask: It is incredible fast, allows for async communication and makes strong use of [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for type hints and function annotators. The later is something that I find particularly cool as FastAPI uses this to create [automatic documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/) for the API using [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui).\n",

    "In this post we went over how to convert a model into a rest API using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). We then went over how to create a web app using FastAPI and [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). This web app prompts the user to enter a paper abstract and passes the text to the model rest API to get the predicted topic of the article. The web app returns the entered text and predicted output. We then deployed the rest API and web app to Google Cloud using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) to make the app serverless! We covered a lot of cool topics in this post, I hope you enjoyed reading it!"
